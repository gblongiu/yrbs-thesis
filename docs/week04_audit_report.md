# Week 1-4 Audit Report

Audit date: 2026-02-09

## Scope
- Verify proposal-aligned completion through Week 4.
- Ensure docs reflect current state truthfully.
- Ensure no claims of completed Week 5+ work.

## Pre-Remediation Snapshot
- Files snapshot:
  - `docs/`: 8 files
  - `outputs/`: 14 files
  - `data/raw/`: 2 files
- Initial completion matrix (before remediation):
  - Week 1: `4/4` present
  - Week 2: `6/7` present (missing `outputs/tables/missingness_modeling.csv`)
  - Week 3: `11/14` present (missing `outputs/tables/weighted_prevalence_by_q2.csv`, `outputs/tables/weighted_prevalence_by_q3.csv`, `outputs/logs/eda_run_metadata.json`)
  - Week 4: `3/5` present (missing `outputs/metrics/metrics_cv_seed2026_logreg_baseline_none.csv`, `outputs/metrics/metrics_test_seed2026_logreg_baseline_none.csv`)

## Duplicate Raw File Check
- Canonical file present: `data/raw/YRBS_2023_Combined_MH_subset.xlsx`
- Typo duplicate file: not present at remediation time (data/raw/YRBS_2023_Combined_MH_subset..xlsx)
- Action taken: none required during this run.

## Remediation Actions Completed
1. Created deterministic environment at `.venv` and installed `requirements.txt`.
2. Added missing support module: `src/evaluation/subgroup_adequacy.py`.
3. Added missing utility package for script compatibility: `src/utils/logging.py`.
4. Regenerated Week 1-3 artifacts via:
   - `scripts/00_validate_environment.py`
   - `scripts/00_schema_audit.py`
   - `scripts/01_build_dataset.py`
   - `scripts/02_eda.py --outdir outputs`
5. Completed Week 4 baseline run via:
   - `scripts/03_train_models.py --model logreg --features baseline --seed 2026 --calibration none --n_boot 0 --outdir outputs`
6. Realigned all files in `docs/` so performed/current claims are Week 1-4 truthful and Week 5+ items are tagged PLANNED.

## Post-Remediation Completion Matrix
- Week 1: complete
- Week 2: complete
- Week 3: complete
- Week 4: complete

Post-remediation file snapshot:
- `docs/`: 11 files
- `outputs/`: 57 files
- `data/raw/`: 2 files

Verified required Week 4 files:
- `outputs/splits/holdout_seed2026.npz`
- `outputs/splits/cvfolds_seed2026.npz`
- `outputs/metrics/metrics_cv_seed2026_logreg_baseline_none.csv`
- `outputs/metrics/metrics_test_seed2026_logreg_baseline_none.csv`
- `docs/modeling_report.md`

## Ghost Scan Result
- No evidence of completed Week 5+ deliverables.
- Future work appears only as explicitly PLANNED entries.

## Evidence Tracking Policy
- Curated Week 1-4 evidence artifacts are intentionally trackable in version control (tables, figures, metrics, splits, and key logs used for grading evidence).
- Sensitive/local data and broad generated byproducts remain ignored.
- Status report output artifacts under `docs/status_reports/report_01/` are intentionally ignored as submission byproducts.

## Validation Results
- Week 1-4 evidence existence checks: PASS
- Doc reference integrity checks (performed/current sections): PASS
- Smoke tests:
  - `pytest -q tests/test_build_dataset_smoke.py`: PASS
  - `pytest -q tests/test_eda_smoke.py`: PASS

## Final Conclusion
Proposal timeline deliverables through Week 4 are complete, and documentation now aligns with current project state without claiming completion beyond Week 4.
